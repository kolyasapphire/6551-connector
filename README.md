# 6551 Account Connector

This tool provides a way to connect to dApps as your 6551 token bound account.

Behind the scenes, it translates transaction requests so that your main wallet interacts with the 6551 account to execute the transaction.

Message signing is also supported so you can log into dApps asking to sign terms of service!
